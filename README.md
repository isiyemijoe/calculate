About Milky way 

Milky Way app uses NASA's Search API to allows users to scroll through the
list of Milky Way images taken in 2017.

Language 

This test was written in Flutter because it's what I'm most comfortable with and I'm hoping to convince you to take a look at flutter if you haven't already, I hop I succeed ðŸ˜„

Architeture

The app was built on the principles of MVC (Model View Controller) Architecture. Concretely seperating View files from controller and data sources

Issues:

1) Parsing String that start with " and also contains " in between the text, such as  "Astronomer discover "dizzy Spin" of the milky way galaxy"

Proposed solution: I feel this should be adjusted backend and only single quite should be used within string

2) Description contains html Tags, It's easier to parse a full html document than a partial htmled document, 

proposed solution: The structure of the links attached in the description should be adjusted so it can be easily consumed my the mobile engineer
